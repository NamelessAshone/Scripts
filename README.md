# About
This directory contains some useful scripts.
In directory */AcrossGFW* I collected some scripts for automatic installation
of SS/SSR/V2Ray on vps.
In directory  */etc* I wrote some simple scripts for:
- clone project from Github by vps
- automatic installation of cool-retro-term
- download file from Internet by vps
